% function sfm
% A demo of the SfM (Structure from Motion) that shows the 3D structure of the points in the space. 
% Either from the original given set of points or the tracked points.
% 
% INPUT
%   Set of point correspondences to be read from local file. 
%
% OUTPUT
%   An image showing the 3D points in their estimated 3D world position.
%       - Yellow dots are when using the given list of points.
%       - Pink dots are when using the tracked points from the LKtracker.
%   M: The transformation matrix size of 2nx3. Where n is the number of cameras i.e. images.
%   S: The estimated 3-dimensional locations of the points (3x#points).
