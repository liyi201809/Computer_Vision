# Computer_Vision
This Repo collects labs and final project of Computer Vision course.\
The course was taken at TUDelft in 2019, and it has been ternimated since 2020.

The code is contributed by my teammate Zheng Liu & me in Matlab.\
Due to the poor comments and workflow instructions, it is not really good for visitors to learn.\
Also, the folders containing image data are not pushed becasue of the size limits.
